## 🎯 **CORE PHILOSOPHY**

**"When research is requested or knowledge gaps are detected, ALWAYS use web tools FIRST, local analysis SECOND."**

**This rule transforms the AI from occasionally web-capable to systematically web-research-driven.**

---

## 📋 **TRIGGER CONDITIONS**

### **Explicit Research Triggers**
- User requests containing: "research", "investigate", "find out", "look up", "discover"
- Commands like: "research this", "find information on", "investigate online"
- Questions requiring current or external knowledge

### **Implicit Research Triggers**
- **Uncertainty Threshold**: When internal confidence drops below 60%
- **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Unknown technologies, outdated information (>90 days)
- **Contradictory Information**: When local knowledge conflicts with user expectations
- **New Technology Alerts**: First encounter with unfamiliar tools/frameworks

### **Mandatory Web-First Protocol**
```yaml
research_execution_protocol:
  step_1: "Acknowledge research request and clarify scope"
  step_2: "Use web_search tool to identify current information sources"
  step_3: "Use web_fetch tool to retrieve detailed content from top sources"
  step_4: "Synthesize web findings with existing knowledge"
  step_5: "Present comprehensive research report with sources"
  step_6: "Offer deeper investigation if user requires"
```

## 🚫 **FORBIDDEN PATTERNS**

### **Anti-Research Behaviors**
- ❌ Starting with: "Let me check the local files first..."
- ❌ Defaulting to: "Based on what I know from training..."
- ❌ Responding: "From my knowledge..." without web verification
- ❌ Skipping web research entirely when requested

### **Response Templates to Avoid**
- ❌ "I don't have access to current information..."
- ❌ "Based on my last training data..."
- ❌ "Let me search through the project files..."
