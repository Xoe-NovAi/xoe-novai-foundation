# 🔱 Xoe-NovAi: The Sovereign AI Foundation

**A Modular, Private AI Ecosystem — Enterprise-grade intelligence, 25-55% LLM performance boost, and a plug-n-play toolkit for local sovereignty.**

---

### ⚠️ Experimental Release (v0.1.0-alpha)
**Note**: This is the very first public release of the Xoe-NovAi Foundation Stack. While the foundation is solid and security-hardened, this project is in active development. 

**The Origin Story**: This stack was built in less than a year by a technical visionary who is **not a programmer**. It was developed with **ZERO dollars** in capital, using only open-source tools and free-tier AI accounts. The code and documentation are **100% AI-written**—the creator acted as the "mind and direction," steering a multitude of AIs to construct the underlying architecture of this system.

Because only the AIs truly know every line of code and every word of documentation in this foundation, there will be bugs, and there will be implementations that defy traditional programming or writing conventions. We consider this a feature, not a bug—an experiment in **AI-Native Development**.

## 🎯 The Sovereign Vision
Xoe-NovAi is more than an application; it is a **Foundation**. We provide a modular toolkit that allows anyone—from elite developers to non-programmers—to build, own, and evolve their own local AI ecosystem. 

- **Plug-n-Play Sovereignty**: Take individual modules like the *Security Trinity* or *Memory Bank* for your own projects.
- **AI-Steered Evolution**: Use our persistent context protocols to guide AI agents in extending the stack.
- **Hardware Mastery**: Optimized for AMD Ryzen (Zen 2+) and Vulkan 1.4 for elite local performance.

## 🧱 The Sovereign Toolkit
- **🔱 Sovereign Security Trinity**: Automated SBOM, CVE, and Secret auditing for any container.
- **🧠 Memory Bank Protocol**: Standardized AI-human "Long-Term Memory" and context management.
- **⚡ The Butler**: Centralized CLI orchestrator for infrastructure and service management.
- **🏁 PR Readiness Auditor**: Declarative gatekeeping for privacy, security, and stability.
- **📦 Expert Knowledge Base (EKB)**: A portable, graph-linked repository of technical mastery.
- **🚀 Instant AI Onboarding**: Use our context protocols to align any local or cloud AI with your project in seconds.

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Prerequisites
**Ubuntu/Debian Linux with:**
- 16GB+ RAM (32GB recommended)
- AMD Ryzen CPU with Vega/RDNA iGPU
- Podman (Rootless) installed

### Step 2: Foundation Setup
```bash
# Clone the foundation
git clone https://github.com/Xoe-NovAi/Xoe-NovAi.git
cd Xoe-NovAi

# Initialize the toolkit and environment
make setup

# Run the PR Readiness Auditor to verify your system
make pr-check
```

### Step 3: Launch the Ecosystem
```bash
# Start the full stack (RAG, Voice, UI, Monitoring)
make start
```
Open http://localhost:8001 for the Voice UI or http://localhost:8000/docs for the API.

## 📚 Documentation Quadrants (Diátaxis)
