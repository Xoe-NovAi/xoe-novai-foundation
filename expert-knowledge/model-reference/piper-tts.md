Primary role: text-to-speech runtime for voice interface tasks.
Primary use-cases: voice UX testing, integration with chainlit/voice runtimes, Phase-2 voice verification.
Knowledge gaps / research tasks:
- Inspect piper/ README to enumerate available voices, licensing, and runtime dependencies.
- Validate integration steps with Chainlit/voice runtime and memory footprint on Ryzen 5700U.
Next steps:
- Add quickstart snippet for generating a test utterance and capturing latency/memory.
