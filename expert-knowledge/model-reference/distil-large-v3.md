Model card: distil-large-v3
Path: models/distil-large-v3 (inspect for metadata)
Format: local model directory — inspect README/metadata before production use.
Primary role: distilled transformer (likely classification/QA)
Primary use-cases: spot classification, QA checks, lightweight inference where available.
Knowledge gaps / research tasks:
- Inspect model metadata to confirm architecture, tokenizer, and exact capabilities.
- Validate inference wrappers and create a small test harness.
Next steps:
- Run metadata inspection and capture results into this model-card.
