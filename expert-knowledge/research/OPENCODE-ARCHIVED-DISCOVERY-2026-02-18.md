# ⚠️ This File Has Been Superseded

> **This document has been renamed and corrected in Sprint 6.**
> The original title "OPENCODE-ARCHIVED-DISCOVERY" was dangerously misleading —
> it implied arcana-novai's use of OpenCode was archived, which is FALSE.

**Please read instead:**

→ **`expert-knowledge/research/OPENCODE-UPSTREAM-ARCHIVE-CONTEXT-2026-02-18.md`**

That document contains all the same technical information (CLI flags, AnyIO integration,
Antigravity plugin setup) with correct framing: the upstream GitHub repo was archived by
*original maintainers*, but **OpenCode is ACTIVE for arcana-novai use**.

---

## Key Corrections Made in v1.1.0

1. **Antigravity uses GitHub OAuth** — NOT Google OAuth (original doc was wrong)
2. **OpenCode status = ACTIVE** — upstream archive ≠ user archive
3. **Researcher model = claude-sonnet-4-6** — NOT claude-opus-4-5 (Sprint 5 signing error)
4. **Fork plan created** — `internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/OPENCODE-XNAI-FORK-PLAN.md`
