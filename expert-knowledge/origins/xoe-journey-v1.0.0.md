# The Xoe-NovAi Journey (v1.0.0)

## Overview
Xoe-NovAi is a $0-capital, open-source experiment in AI-steered development. It was born from the need to shatter the dependency on opaque cloud AI and provide a modular foundation for sovereign intelligence.

## The Vision: AI-Native Sovereignty
To build a system that is 100% offline, zero-telemetry, and air-gap ready by default. We move beyond "using" AI to "evolving" with it, where human architects steer autonomous agents to build the features they need.

## Core Milestones
- **The Bootstrap**: Initializing the stack on Ryzen 5700U hardware.
- **The Trinity**: Implementing Syft, Grype, and Trivy for bulletproof local security.
- **The Hub**: Establishing xoe-novai-sync/ for seamless local-cloud synergy.
- **The Expert**: Transitioning to domain-isolated "Expert Datasets."

## Ethical North Star (Ma'at)
All project evolution is guided by the 42 Ideals of Ma'at, prioritizing sincerity, sovereignty, and resource stewardship.
