## Strategic Alignment

These ideals are not merely philosophical; they map directly to Xoe-NovAi's technical architecture:

-   **Integrity & Abilities (40, 41):** Sovereignty, local-only processing, and advancing without telemetry or external dependencies.
-   **Truth & Sincerity (7, 9):** Hallucination-free RAG outputs and transparent agent state reporting.
-   **Balance & Purity (18, 20, 36):** Resource efficiency (<6GB RAM), clean code standards, and "keeping the waters pure" (data privacy).
-   **Harmony & Awareness (25, 33):** Seamless multi-agent coordination and contextual awareness.
