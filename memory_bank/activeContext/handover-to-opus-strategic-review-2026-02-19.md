# Handover to Opus 4.6: Strategic Review & CLI Recovery

## Objectives
1. **Strategic Audit**: Review and approve `UNIFIED-STRATEGY-v1.0.md`, `PROJECT-QUEUE.yaml`, and the new `OPUS-TOKEN-STRATEGY.md`.
2. **CLI Diagnosis**: Analyze the context overflow bug in OpenCode CLI and provide a remediation plan.
3. **Tier 1 Launch**: Initiate execution of Tier 1 (Production Blockers) defined in the Project Queue.

## Strategic Questions for Opus
1. **Unified Strategy**: Does the 4-tier project hierarchy provide sufficient isolation between the technical foundation and the esoteric superstructure while maintaining overall architectural coherence?
2. **Project Queue**: Are the priority rankings (P-001 through P-016) optimal for immediate infrastructure stability?
3. **Token Management**: Is the "summarize-and-checkpoint" protocol sufficient to prevent future overflows, or do we need a more aggressive "Fresh Context" routine?
4. **Context Overflow Bug**: Based on the behavior of messages reaching 290K (well beyond the 200K window), where is the most likely failure point in the OpenCode context management pipeline?
