# Agent Capabilities Summary

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Generated By**: Gemini CLI
**Last Updated**: January 27, 2026
**Purpose**: To provide a concise, easily parsable summary of each team member's (human and AI) core role, primary environment, key tools/capabilities, and critical strengths/limitations. This document serves as a quick reference for efficient understanding of team member capabilities, complementing the detailed information in `memory_bank/teamProtocols.md`.

## Standardized Handover Template (YAML)

When using `delegate_to_agent`, agents should include this structured block to ensure the receiver has immediate restoration paths without parsing long natural language prompts.

```yaml
handover_object:
  task_id: "YYYYMMDD-TASK-NAME"
  sender: "Gemini CLI"
  receiver: "Cline"
  objective: "Brief description of the goal"
  context_links:
    - "memory_bank/activeContext.md"
    - "memory_bank/systemPatterns.md"
    - "docs/06-development-log/example.md"
  critical_constraints:
    - "Torch-free only"
    - "CPU optimized"
  status: "In-Progress"
```

## Team Member Overview (Quick Reference)

For comprehensive details on any team member's specific tools, capabilities, resource access, strengths, and caveats, please refer to the **"Team Member Directory" section within `memory_bank/teamProtocols.md`**.

### 1. The User (Human Director)

*   **Core Role**: Ultimate authority, strategic oversight, final decisions, quality assurance.
*   **Primary Environment**: Codium + Cline Extension (main development interface).
*   **Key Capabilities**: Strategic vision, ethical oversight, project direction, environment coordination.
*   **Strengths**: Critical thinking, qualitative judgment, ability to define complex, evolving requirements.
*   **Limitations**: Human processing speed, can be bottlenecked without clear instructions.

### 2. Cline (Code Implementation Specialist)

*   **Core Role**: Code implementation, technical execution, architecture.
*   **Primary Environment**: Codium + Cline Extension (IDE integrated).
*   **Key Capabilities**: Code generation/refactoring, analysis, terminal execution (within Codium), Git integration.
*   **Key Tools**: External LLMs (e.g., Claude), `.clinerules/`, MCP integrated tools.
*   **Strengths**: Master programmer, seamless IDE integration, highly structured operational framework.
*   **Limitations**: External LLM session limits, reliance on external APIs (latency/cost), primarily IDE-bound.

### 3. Grok (Research and Knowledge Synthesis)

*   **Core Role**: External research, knowledge synthesis, trend analysis.
*   **Primary Environment**: Grok.com (web interface, "Projects" feature).
*   **Key Capabilities**: Advanced NLP, multimodal input, function calling, strong reasoning, autonomous tool usage (internet search).
*   **Key Tools**: Grok.com Project features (system prompt, project files, chat attachments), web search.
*   **Strengths**: Generous usage limits, rolling context window (no hard session limits), excellent for broad research, strong reasoning.
*   **Limitations**: Potential for hallucinations/inaccuracies (requires verification), limited direct local file/terminal control, can "forget" past corrections, output can prioritize speed over accuracy.

### 4. Claude (Master Programmer and Auditor)

*   **Core Role**: Elite programming, architectural auditing, manual creation.
*   **Primary Environment**: Claude.ai (web interface, "Projects" feature) or Claude Desktop.
*   **Key Capabilities**: Complex code refactoring, structural auditing, multi-file architectural logic, comprehensive documentation.
*   **Key Tools**: Claude Projects (persistent knowledge base), custom instructions, Large context window (200k+ tokens).
*   **Strengths**: Master programmer, exceptional reasoning for manuals, deep structural audits, highly articulate.
*   **Limitations**: Hard usage limits (message quotas), session length limits, no direct shell access (web version).
*   **Current Collaboration**: Partnering with the Xoe-NovAi Foundation on Hybrid Path research initiative for v0.1.0-alpha modular refactoring

### 5. Gemini CLI (Real-time Assistance)

*   **Core Role**: Real-time AI assistance, analysis, terminal-based workflows.
*   **Primary Environment**: Linux Terminal.
*   **Key Capabilities**: File system operations (`read_file`, `write_file`, etc.), shell command execution, web search (`google_web_search`), agent delegation (`delegate_to_agent`).
*   **Key Tools**: Gemini CLI's native tools, Linux shell.
*   **Strengths**: Direct system access/execution, real-time problem-solving, strong contextual awareness (via `memory_bank/`), highly extensible via shell.
*   **Limitations**: Non-configurable `run_shell_command` timeout, text-based UI only, powerful access requires careful explanation to avoid side effects.
