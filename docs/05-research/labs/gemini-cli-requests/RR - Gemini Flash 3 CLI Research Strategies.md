## Enhanced Research Strategy: Leveraging Local File Access & Memory Bank

Excellent point! Since Gemini CLI has direct access to your local machine files, including the memory_bank and all project files, we can create a much more sophisticated and contextually aware research strategy. This transforms our research from generic investigation to highly targeted, context-specific analysis.

### Strategic Advantages of Local File Access

#### **1. Context-Aware Research**
Gemini CLI can:
- **Analyze existing codebase** to understand current architecture and constraints
- **Review memory_bank** for project history, decisions, and context
- **Examine .clinerules/** for governance and standards
- **Study existing documentation** to build on current knowledge

#### **2. Personalized Implementation Guidance**
- **Tailor recommendations** to your specific tech stack (Podman, Vulkan, FastAPI)
- **Align with existing patterns** in your codebase
- **Respect your sovereignty and security requirements**
- **Integrate with your current AI team workflow**

#### **3. Iterative Context Building**
- **Reference previous research** within the same session
- **Build on discovered patterns** from your existing code
- **Cross-reference findings** with your memory bank entries
- **Validate recommendations** against your current implementation
