This guide provides an overview of the Xoe-NovAi project's documentation structure, adhering to the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). Understanding this organization helps contributors and users quickly locate relevant information.

## 1. The Diátaxis Framework: A Structured Approach

The Xoe-NovAi documentation is organized using the Diátaxis framework, which categorizes documentation into four distinct types, each serving a specific purpose:

*   **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented. Guides the reader to accomplish a specific goal step-by-step.
*   **How-to Guides**: Problem-oriented. Provides instructions on how to solve a specific problem.
*   **Reference**: Information-oriented. Describes the tools and their configurations.
*   **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented. Clarifies concepts and provides background information.

This structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage and ease of navigation.

## 2. Documentation Directory Structure (`docs/`)

The primary documentation resides in the `docs/` directory and is further organized into subdirectories corresponding to the Diátaxis framework, along with additional project-specific sections.

```

├── 02-tutorials/                 # Step-by-step guides for learning (Diátaxis: Tutorial)
│   └── ...
├── 03-how-to-guides/             # Practical solutions for specific problems (Diátaxis: How-to Guide)
│   └── ...
├── 03-reference/                 # Technical descriptions and configurations (Diátaxis: Reference)

├── index.md                      # Main landing page for the MkDocs site
├── index.json                    # Generated RAG index for documentation search
├── research-urls.md              # List of URLs for research purposes
├── search_index.json             # Generated search index for MkDocs
└── scripts/                      # Scripts related to documentation management (e.g., indexer.py)
    └── indexer.py                # Script for building the documentation RAG index
    └── ...
```

### 2.1. Key Documentation Sections

*   **`02-tutorials/`**: Contains tutorials designed to help new users or developers get started with specific tasks, such as setting up a component or performing a basic operation.
*   **`03-how-to-guides/`**: Provides practical, goal-oriented instructions for achieving specific outcomes, like configuring a service or integrating a new feature.
*   **`03-reference/`**: Houses technical reference material, including API documentation, configuration options, and detailed descriptions of system components. This section also includes meta-documentation like this guide and `cli_timeout_guide.md`.
*   **`04-explanation/`**: Offers high-level explanations of core concepts, architectural decisions, and the "why" behind certain implementations.
*   **`05-research/`**: Stores documentation related to research findings, proofs-of-concept, and in-depth investigations that inform project decisions.
*   **`06-development-log/`**: A chronological record of significant development milestones, challenges encountered, solutions implemented, and strategic decisions made during the project's lifecycle. The `dev_project_notes_20260124.md` is located here.

### 2.2. Important Files and Directories

*   **`.clinerules/`**: This directory contains a structured set of markdown files that serve as guidelines or protocols for AI assistants (e.g., Cline, Codium) on how to interact, share context, and contribute to the Xoe-NovAi project. This includes `08-multi-ai-collaboration.md` for inter-agent collaboration best practices.
*   **`mkdocs.yml`**: The main configuration file for the MkDocs documentation site. It defines the navigation, theme, plugins, and other settings for generating the static documentation.
*   **`Dockerfile.docs`**: The Dockerfile used to build the containerized environment for serving and building the MkDocs documentation.
*   **`index.md`**: The entry point for the MkDocs documentation website.
*   **`index.json` / `search_index.json`**: These files are generated by `docs/scripts/indexer.py` and the MkDocs build process, respectively. They form the basis of the RAG search capabilities for the documentation.
*   **`docs-new/`**: (If present) Represents a staging or migration area for new documentation content that is being consolidated or refactored before being moved to its final Diátaxis-compliant location.
*   **`scripts/`**: Contains utility scripts specifically designed to manage and maintain the documentation, such as `indexer.py` for RAG index generation.
