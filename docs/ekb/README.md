# Expert Knowledge Base (EKB) Documentation

This folder contains documentation and usage guides for the Expert Knowledge Base system.

## Overview

The Expert Knowledge Base (EKB) is a structured system for organizing and accessing specialized knowledge across different domains within the Xoe-NovAi Foundation project.

## Structure

The actual expert knowledge bases are located in the root `expert-knowledge/` directory, organized by domain:

- **`expert-knowledge/architect/`** - Architectural patterns and design decisions
- **`expert-knowledge/coder/`** - Coding standards and best practices  
- **`expert-knowledge/environment/`** - Environment setup and configuration
- **`expert-knowledge/infrastructure/`** - Infrastructure patterns and deployment
- **`expert-knowledge/security/`** - Security practices and protocols
- **`expert-knowledge/protocols/`** - Communication and workflow protocols
- **`expert-knowledge/research/`** - Research findings and methodologies
- **`expert-knowledge/origins/`** - Project history and foundational concepts
- **`expert-knowledge/sync/`** - Synchronization and integration patterns

## Usage

The EKB system provides:

1. **Structured Knowledge Organization** - Domain-specific expertise in standardized formats
2. **Cross-Reference Integration** - Links between related knowledge across domains  
3. **Version Control** - Track changes and evolution of expert knowledge
4. **Search and Discovery** - Easy access to specialized information

## Integration

The EKB integrates with:
- Documentation generation (MkDocs)
- Development workflows
- Research processes
- Team protocols and standards

## Contributing

To add new expert knowledge:
1. Identify the appropriate domain folder in `expert-knowledge/`
2. Follow the established template patterns
3. Add cross-references where relevant
4. Update this documentation if needed
