# 🔱 Xoe-NovAi Foundation Stack

**Sovereign AI Assistant | Modular Foundation | AMD Ryzen Optimized**

Welcome to the official documentation for the Xoe-NovAi Foundation Stack. This project is a "Great AI-Native Experiment"—a professional-grade AI toolkit built 100% by AI agents, directed by a non-programmer with zero capital.

## ⚖️ The Sovereignty Promise
Xoe-NovAi is built on the **42 Ideals of Ma'at**, enforcing:
- **Zero Telemetry**: No data leaves your system. Ever.
- **Offline-First**: Every component runs locally on consumer hardware.
- **Torch-Free**: Optimized for CPU/Vulkan using GGUF, ONNX, and CTranslate2.

## 🎯 Core Stack
The v0.1.0-alpha Foundation consists of 7 modular services:
1. **RAG API**: FastAPI-based retrieval augmented generation.
2. **Chainlit UI**: Interactive web and voice interface.
3. **Redis**: High-performance session and state management.
4. **Knowledge Crawler**: Sovereign data ingestion engine.
5. **Curation Worker**: AI-driven content quality filtering.
6. **Documentation Service**: This MkDocs-powered portal.
7. **The Butler**: Infrastructure orchestration TUI.
