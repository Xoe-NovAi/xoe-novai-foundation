# 🚀 Deep Research Request: H-RAG (Graph-Relational Hybrid Retrieval)
## AI Provider: Nova (Grok 4.1 Research) - Strategic Intelligence Focus

**Research ID**: HRAG-KUZU-001
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Entity Reasoning Foundation
**Estimated Research Depth**: Elite (Architectural Logic + Implementation)

---

## 🎯 **Research Overview**

### **Core Research Question**
How can **Kùzu Graph** be integrated into the Xoe-NovAi RAG pipeline to move from simple vector similarity to relational fact-linking, and how does this impact retrieval precision in an 8GB RAM constraint?

### **Strategic Importance**
Vector-only RAG lacks the "Structural Logic" required for complex architectural reasoning. H-RAG provides the "Entity Memory" needed for Phase 6 intelligence.

### **Expected Outcomes**
- Embedded Kùzu Graph schema for Diátaxis-linked facts.
- Path-based retrieval patterns for cross-interval document linking.
- Benchmarks for Graph RAM footprint (<150MB target).

## 🔬 **Detailed Research Requirements**

### **1. Graph-Relational Architecture (40% Focus)**
- Research **Kùzu** (embedded) integration with **FAISS**.
- Define the "Path-Based Retrieval" logic for multi-hop reasoning.
- **Strategic Improvement (Ma'at Alignment)**: Ensure the graph structure reflects the "Truth" quadrant of Diátaxis, maintaining clear lineage between raw curated data and fused facts.

### **2. Hardware Constraint Guardrails (30% Focus)**
- **Constraint**: Peak RAM < 150MB for the Graph service.
- Research zero-copy data transfer between SQLite metadata and Kùzu nodes.
- Analyze CPU overhead of graph traversals on Ryzen 5700U Cores 0-5.

### **3. Agentic Synchronization (20% Focus)**
- **Cline (Code)**: Implementation of the `GraphRetriever` class.
- **Nova (Research)**: Continuous intake of new fact-linking patterns.
- **Gemini (Audit)**: Automated validation of graph integrity and RRF tie-breaking.

### **4. Adversarial Defense (10% Focus)**
- Research "Graph Injection" risks (malicious facts attempting to hijack relational reasoning).
- Develop sanitization patterns for nodes and edges.

## 📋 **Success Criteria**

### **Technical Excellence**
- Recall@10 > 95% on technical troubleshooting queries.
- <50ms traversal latency for 3-hop relationship queries.
- Zero OOM crashes during concurrent RAG/Graph operations.

### **Sovereign Impact**
- 100% local processing (Zero telemetry).
- Transparent audit trail for all relational inferences.

## ⏰ **Timeline Expectations**
- **Research Completion**: 3 hours.
- **Integration Readiness**: 1-2 days.

**Research Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL
