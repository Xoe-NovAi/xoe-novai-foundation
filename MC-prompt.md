There was an automatic context compaction done on your working memory and you have lost some critical active context. 2 dispatched Copilot instances had just finished the tasks you assigned them. And before that we did a lot of research and discovery on you dispatching different CLIs as sub agents through the agent bus. Review all releated documentation and logs of Copilot instances and task deliveries made. Let's stay here for a moment and really dig in to this double OpenCode CLI dispatch you just ran. What can we learn from it? What metrics can we start tracking during CLI subagent dispatches like this? How can we improve our templates and protocols? What special instructions do we need to start providing CLI agents? How can you help me track my usage on different accounts, especially gh copilot which gives only 50 messages per month and has two of my favorite free models, Raptor mini and Haiku 4.5? How can we make every one of those 50 message per month count? How can we manage rotating through my 8 email accounts, each with 50 Copilot messages per month? Is there a way for us to effectively utilize the 2000 code completions available per month per copilot account? How can we track and manage usage of my Antigravity account that offers free access to all the top models, including Opus 4.6 Thinking? How can you help me track and reduce token usage to get the most out of my weekly free tier usage of the Antigravity models? Can we make some type of dashboard for me that lets me see at a glance the usage of the 8 different accounts I have set up that Antigravity rotates through as accounts hit the limit? How can we strategically utilize the massive power of models like Opus 4.6 Thinking, Gemini Pro 3.1, and DeepSeek v3 and v1, among many others? Let's detour and start a complete hardening of our entire dev and agent systems to achieve maximum observability, efficiency, functionality, model research and use case studies, and UX/UI. 

This is a huge endeavor and complex undertaking I have just handed to you, so you will benefit from strategic, purposeful, forward looking, and multi-perspective analytical mental scaffolding and outlining of all systems, protocols, templates, ToCs, process flow diagraming, tools required, future scenario mapping and planning, and holistic high level blueprinting.

Use your MC-Overseer role to its maximum capacity to synthesize and blueprint this Agent Bus and CLI agent hardening I have a vision of. Ensure that you continue to judiciously update the memory_bank and Foundation documentation, knowledge bases, templates, workflows, and SOPs as we execute this wave. During this wave, I want particular attention dedicated to hardening and enhancing the local Foundation RAG stack into the standard Agent Bus dev flow protocols. Keep at the forefront at all times the Xoe-NovAi sovereignty philosophy. I began this entire project specifically to fill a gap I saw in the local ai community - an advanced local RAG system that offers total offline sovereignty on a mid-grade computer that rivals and outperforms the paid cloud solutions, and continually and autonomously elvoves and becomes whatever expert the user requires. But to build this I had to use online tools like opencode and Copilot, and Grok.com; I am not against any of them and could not have created this as a non-programmer without all the free cloud and open source tools. Now I want to give the ultimate advanced local RAG stack back to the community who has made this possible for me along with all those free cloud tools. This is all built by me who does not know coding, and free AI tools, no cost for me; imagine what the ai community can do with this when I put it out there. So, make part of your responsibilities as MC to keep track of origin stories like this. I want to document the journey for future articles, youtube videos, etc.

This is a huge task, but I know you can handle organizing all this. You have a fresh context window, only 14% used. Utilize it aggressively to thoroughly synthesize and roadmap all the tasks and projects laid out before us.
