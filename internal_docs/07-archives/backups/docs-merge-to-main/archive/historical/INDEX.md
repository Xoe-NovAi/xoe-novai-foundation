# Archived Documents Index

This folder contains archived snapshots of documentation that were previously at the repository root.

Purpose:
- Preserve original copies before canonicalization into `docs/`.
- Provide an audit trail and simple links to canonical docs.

Archived Files (moved from repository root):

- `LOCAL_TELEMETRY_FREE_TTS_OPTIONS_2025.md` → Canonical: `docs/LOCAL_TELEMETRY_FREE_TTS_OPTIONS_2025.md`
- `PIPER_ONNX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (archived as `docs/archived/PIPER_ONNX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_archive - 01_04_2026.md`) → Canonical: `docs/PIPER_ONNX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_PIPER_ONNX.md` → Canonical: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_PIPER_ONNX.md`
- `WHEELHOUSE_BUILD_TRACKING.md` → Canonical: `docs/WHEELHOUSE_BUILD_TRACKING.md`
- `UPDATES_RUNNING.md` → Canonical (active runbook): `docs/UPDATES_RUNNING.md`

Notes:
- Each archived file below is the original root snapshot as of the move date (January 4, 2026).
- Use the canonical `docs/` copies for the current project state and the `archive/` copies for historical reference.

If you add or update canonical docs, please update this index.
