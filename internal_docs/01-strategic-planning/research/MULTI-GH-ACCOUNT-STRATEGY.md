title: "Multi-GitHub Account & Branch Management Strategy"
last_updated: 2026-02-16

Purpose
- Provide a practical, minimal-risk strategy for using multiple GitHub accounts and branches across the XOH (XNAi Orchestration & Hardening) project.
- Locate existing docs and call out knowledge gaps for follow-up research and policy enforcement.

Existing documentation (locations found)
- GitHub workflow & conventions (archived): internal_docs/07-archives/backups/docs-merge-to-main/howto/github-protocol-guide.md
- Repository-level Copilot & orchestration policies: internal_docs/00-project-standards/COPILOT-CUSTOM-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Docs & policies index / archive: internal_docs/07-archives/backups/docs-merge-to-main/README.md
- Implementation & tooling context (expert knowledge): expert-knowledge/environment/development-workflows/tool-stack.md
- Documentation strategy & genealogy: internal_docs/DOCUMENTATION-GENEALOGY.md and internal_docs/DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM-STRATEGY.md

Short summary of observed facts
- A comprehensive GitHub protocol guide exists in archives (howto/github-protocol-guide.md) and should be canonicalized under docs/howto/ or internal_docs/policies.
- Repo already contains project-level Copilot custom instructions and other governance docs (owners/policies patterns exist in internal_docs/policies).
- Multiple accounts are referenced operationally in conversation (admin: xoe.nova.ai@gmail.com; active user: lilithasterion@gmail.com). No single canonical owners file listing all GitHub accounts was found; this is a gap.

Recommended policy (high level)
1. Roles & Accounts (minimum)
   - Admin / Owner account: Xoe-NovAi (xoe.nova.ai@gmail.com) — organization owner; only used for administrative operations: merge-release, manage secrets, org-level settings.
   - Primary Developer account: lilithasterion (lilithasterion@gmail.com) — everyday development, PRs, feature branches.
   - Contributor accounts: other personal accounts (contributors) — limited rights, PRs through forks or feature branches.
   - Service/accounts for automation: use dedicated machine/service accounts for CI & bots (no human login), with rotating tokens and minimal permissions.

2. Organization & Teams
   - Use a GitHub Organization (if not already) for Xoe-NovAi and assign team roles: Owners, Admins, Developers, Reviewers, Contributors.
   - Map each human account to a GitHub user; add them to the appropriate team.
   - Document every account in a canonical `policies/OWNERS.md` or `internal_docs/00-project-standards/OWNERS.md` with email, GitHub username, role, and contact.

3. Branching & PRs
   - Protect `main` (require PR, require CI passing, require 1-2 approvers depending on change severity, disallow force push).
   - Use `develop` or `staging` for integration work (optional). Standard flow: feature/* → develop → PR → main (or feature/* → PR → main for small teams).
   - Branch naming conventions: feature/<short-desc>, bugfix/<issue-id>, hotfix/<short-desc>, docs/<desc>, chore/<desc>.
   - For large document reorganizations (like PHASE reorg), use a dedicated branch `phase-reorg/<ticket>` and request cross-team review.

4. Copilot & Multi-Account Management
   - Copilot usage should map to human accounts, not shared or admin accounts; avoid using the admin account for Copilot to prevent overreach.
   - If multiple Copilot seats are used (free-tier management), maintain a mapping table in `internal_docs/00-project-standards/COPILOT-ACCOUNT-MAP.md` with which account is used for which task class.
   - Explicitly forbid committing credentials generated by Copilot or agents; use PR review to confirm no secrets are included.

5. Secrets & Tokens
   - Use repository or organization secrets for CI; rotate tokens regularly.
   - Use least-privilege PATs (Personal Access Tokens) scoped to necessary actions; prefer fine-grained tokens.
   - Document token owners and rotation policy in `policies/SECRETS.md`.

6. Merge & Release authority
   - Enforce that only Org Owners or designated Release Managers (team membership) can merge to `main` for production changes.
   - For expedited hotfixes, use `hotfix/*` + PR with at least one admin approval.

7. Audit & Record-Keeping
   - Maintain `internal_docs/00-project-standards/GITHUB-ACCOUNTS.md` listing all known GitHub usernames, emails, roles, and last verification timestamp.
   - Automate periodic audit tasks: check org membership, team assignments, and repository-level branch protection rules.

Actionable next steps (short-term)
- [ ] Canonicalize archived GitHub protocol guide: move `/internal_docs/07-archives/backups/docs-merge-to-main/howto/github-protocol-guide.md` → `internal_docs/policies/GITHUB-PROTOCOL-GUIDE.md` (proposed reorg; will create a PR).
- [ ] Create `internal_docs/00-project-standards/OWNERS.md` (canonical account list) and populate with known accounts (xoe.nova.ai@gmail.com, lilithasterion@gmail.com); verify via GitHub org invite/confirmation.
- [ ] Create `internal_docs/00-project-standards/COPILOT-ACCOUNT-MAP.md` to record Copilot seat distribution and intended usage to avoid hitting free-tier limits inadvertently.
- [ ] Enforce branch protection for `main` and document required reviewers by team.
- [ ] Add a Vikunja task to audit current GitHub org membership and branch protections (task: `vikunja_tasks/github_accounts_and_protection_audit.json`).

Knowledge gaps for follow-up research
- Exact list of GitHub usernames and which accounts are already org members — requires a GitHub API/org check (credentials required; offline doc may exist in archives but must be validated).
- Which Copilot seats are assigned to which email addresses (project owner must confirm per-account usage).
- Any historical PRs or merges done under non-standard accounts (audit required via `git shortlog` and org membership review).

Deliverables I'll create next (if approved)
- `internal_docs/00-project-standards/OWNERS.md` (canonical account list)
- `internal_docs/00-project-standards/COPILOT-ACCOUNT-MAP.md` (Copilot seat mapping)
- Vikunja task: `vikunja_tasks/github_accounts_and_protection_audit.json`
- PR proposal to move archived `github-protocol-guide.md` into canonical policies folder

Security & sovereignty notes
- Do not publish account tokens or PATs in repo. Use Podman secret files or local-only secret storage for CI credentials where possible.
- For Copilot/CLI tooling that may connect externally, ensure the repository-level copilot instructions require no telemetry and forbid external model calls by default.

If you'd like, merge the archive guide into policies now and I will create the OWNERS and COPILOT mapping files and open the audit Vikunja task. Otherwise I can just create the task and draft PRs for your review.
