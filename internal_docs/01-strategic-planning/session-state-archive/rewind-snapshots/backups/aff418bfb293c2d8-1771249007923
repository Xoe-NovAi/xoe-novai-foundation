**Copy this and customize with your submission method**:

```
Hello! I'm preparing for a complex 19.5-hour Phase 5 operationalization 
for the XNAi Foundation - a sovereign, air-gapped multi-agent RAG system.

I'm submitting comprehensive context materials for your architectural review:

📋 MATERIALS INCLUDED:
1. CLAUDE-CONTEXT-XNAI-STACK.md - Complete system architecture
2. CLAUDE-AGENT-PERFORMANCE-GUIDE.md - Agent patterns & optimization
3. CLAUDE-MODEL-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md - Model strategy & trade-offs
4. CLAUDE-KNOWLEDGE-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md - Knowledge integration pipeline

6. CLAUDE-AI-DELIVERY-PACKAGE-SUMMARY.md - Orientation guide

PLUS:
7. MASTER-PLAN-v3.1.md - Complete 15-phase execution plan

📌 INITIAL QUESTIONS:
1. Does the 15-phase structure make sense for this scope?
2. Are the 5 parallel tracks appropriately scoped?
3. What are the critical risks I'm not seeing?
4. Which phases would most benefit from real-time guidance?

🔬 FOLLOW-UP: I have 5 specific T5-Ancient-Greek model selection 
research questions to submit separately (for Phase 10, hour 12+).

Ready to review materials?
```

## 🔄 WHAT TO EXPECT FROM CLAUDE

### Initial Response (30-60 minutes)
Claude will likely respond with:
- ✅ Acknowledgment of materials received
- ✅ High-level assessment of plan structure
- ✅ Identification of critical risks
- ✅ Questions about specific trade-offs
- ✅ Suggestions for prioritization

### After You Submit T5 Questions
Claude will provide:
- ✅ Detailed research on T5-Ancient-Greek viability
- ✅ Comparison with BERT and Krikri
- ✅ mmap() feasibility assessment
- ✅ Decision framework with trade-offs
- ✅ Recommendations with rationale

### At Checkpoint Gates (Hours 5.6, 9, 14, 18.5)
Ask Claude for:
- ✅ Progress assessment
- ✅ Adjustment recommendations
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Optimization opportunities
- ✅ Timeline validity

---

## 💬 SAMPLE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

After Claude reviews the plan, you might ask:

### For Architecture Validation
"Based on your review of our architecture, what are the 3 highest-impact 
optimizations we should prioritize in Phase 10 (Ancient Greek models)?"

### For Risk Mitigation
"We identified these risks: [list]. Which ones concern you most, and what 
mitigation strategies would you recommend?"

### For Model Selection
"For T5 vs BERT+Krikri trade-off, what decision criteria would you use?"

### For Agent Performance
"What is the optimal worker pool size for concurrent inference on 
Ryzen 5700U with 6 cores, 6GB RAM constraint?"

### For Knowledge Integration
"How should we structure Phase 12 (Knowledge Integration) to ensure 
all research findings become permanent improvements?"

---

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA

After submission, you'll know it went well if Claude provides:

- ✅ Clear assessment of plan structure
- ✅ Specific risk identification
- ✅ Actionable recommendations
- ✅ Trade-off analysis for key decisions
- ✅ Feasibility assessment for mmap() strategy
- ✅ T5 research guidance (when submitted)

---

## 🎯 KEY POINTS FOR CLAUDE

Make sure Claude understands:

1. **Sovereignty Constraints**
   - Air-gapped (no external APIs)
   - 6GB RAM fixed (no scaling up)
   - Ryzen 5700U only (no GPU acceleration)
   - All data local

2. **Model Strategy**
   - BERT: Resident, <100ms latency, morphological analysis
   - Krikri: mmap() loading, 5-10s cold, 0.5-2s hot
   - T5: Under investigation (5 research questions)

3. **Execution Model**
   - 15 phases, 5 parallel tracks, 19.5 hours
   - 4 checkpoint gates prevent mid-phase disruption
   - Copilot + Cline + Claude collaboration expected

4. **Timeline**
   - Phase 1-5: 6.8 hours (operations)
   - Phase 6-8: 4.25 hours (documentation, parallel)
   - Phase 9-11: 4.67 hours (research, sequential)
   - Phase 12-15: 3.75 hours (integration & cleanup)

---

## 📞 IF CLAUDE ASKS CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

Common questions Claude might ask:

**Q: "Why not use larger models if you have 6GB?"**
A: mmap() strategy allows 5.5GB files with only 50MB resident overhead. 
   This is the key optimization that makes it work.

**Q: "What about quantization to Q2 or Q3 for smaller footprint?"**
A: Acceptable, but Q5_K_M balances quality (92% accuracy) with size 
   (5.5GB file). Research underway on T5 as lighter alternative.

**Q: "Can you scale to multiple hosts?"**
A: Not in Phase 5 scope. Single Ryzen 5700U is current constraint. 
   Phase 16+ research includes horizontal scaling.

**Q: "How do you handle model updates/retraining?"**
A: Currently loading from downloaded GGUF files. Fine-tuning out of scope 
   for Phase 5. Phase 16+ research queue includes continuous learning.

5. Update MASTER-PLAN if significant changes

### When to Ask Follow-Up Questions
