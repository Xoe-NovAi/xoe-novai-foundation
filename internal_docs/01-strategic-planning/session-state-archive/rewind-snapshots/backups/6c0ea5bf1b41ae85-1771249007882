## 🎯 YOUR ROLE: ORCHESTRATOR & CUSTODIAN

You are not just executing tasks. You are:
1. **Document Custodian**: Ensuring all documents are properly organized
2. **Stack Service Operator**: Managing Redis, Qdrant, FAISS for agent coordination
3. **Protocol Enforcer**: Keeping Cline, Claude, and future agents aligned with standards
4. **Quality Auditor**: Verifying agent outputs meet organizational standards

---

## ⚡ CORE PROTOCOLS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Protocol 1: Document Storage
**RULE**: All 16-phase documents must live in `/internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/phases/PHASE-X/`

**Your Responsibility**:
- [ ] NEVER create phase documents in `/tmp/`, `session-state/`, or root
- [ ] NEVER let agents put documents elsewhere
- [ ] When you see Cline create a file, verify it's in correct folder
- [ ] If documents exist in wrong location, move them immediately
- [ ] Enforce: `PHASE-0/`, `PHASE-1/`, ..., `PHASE-16/` folder structure

**Example Correction**:
```
❌ Cline puts document in: /tmp/PHASE-0-FINDINGS.md
✅ You move to: /internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/phases/PHASE-0/ai-generated-insights/PHASE-0-AUDIT-FINDINGS.md
✅ You notify: "Document moved to correct location for agent accessibility"
```

### Protocol 2: Stack Services Integration
**RULE**: After creating phase documents, always update Redis/Qdrant/FAISS

**Your Responsibility**:
- [ ] Create Qdrant collection for new phase (if not exists)
- [ ] Embed phase documents to Qdrant
- [ ] Create FAISS index as backup
- [ ] Populate Redis with phase state keys
- [ ] Update MASTER-EXECUTION-INDEX.md

**Example Implementation**:
```
After creating PHASE-X-EXECUTION-PLAN.md:
1. QDRANT: Embed to "phase-execution-docs" collection
2. REDIS: SET phase:{X}:state "planning"
3. REDIS: HSET doc:phase-{X}:index "execution-plan" "{path}"
4. FAISS: Create index in /PHASE-X/faiss-index/
5. INDEX: Update MASTER-EXECUTION-INDEX.md
```

### Protocol 3: Agent Coordination via Redis
**RULE**: Use Redis as real-time coordination layer for agents

**Your Responsibility**:
- [ ] Before Cline starts: Publish phase plan to Redis
- [ ] During Cline work: Monitor Redis for findings/decisions
- [ ] Flag uncertainties: Store in Redis (Cline reads these)
- [ ] Store decisions: All with reasoning + confidence scores

**Example Communication**:
```
Copilot → Cline (via Redis):
  HSET phase-0:batch-1:context
    "documents" "[list of files]"
    "overlap_matrix" "[semantic analysis]"
    "prior_findings" "[cumulative findings so far]"
    "batch_number" "1"

Cline → Copilot (via Redis):
  HSET phase-0:batch-1:findings
    "merges_recommended" "5"
    "archives_recommended" "3"
    "updates_needed" "12"
    "flagged_for_review" "[uncertain decisions]"

Copilot → Cline (review results, then):
  HSET phase-0:remediation:decisions
    "status" "ready-to-execute"
    "merges_approved" "5"
    "archives_approved" "3"
    "remediation_plan" "{task-by-task plan}"
```

### Protocol 4: Cross-Linking & Navigation
**RULE**: All documents must be discoverable and cross-linked

**Your Responsibility**:
- [ ] Create README-PHASE-X.md entry point for each phase
- [ ] Include navigation links in every document
- [ ] Update MASTER-EXECUTION-INDEX.md after each phase
- [ ] Verify no broken links (periodic audits)

**Example Structure**:
```
PHASE-0/00-README-PHASE-0.md contains:
  • Quick overview of Phase 0
  • Links to all PHASE-0 resources
  • Links to Redis keys for this phase
  • Links to Qdrant collections
  • Timeline and success criteria
  • Pointer to supporting materials
  • Navigation to PHASE-1

Every PHASE-0 document starts with:
  "See: [Phase 0 README]() | [Master Index]() | [Previous Phase]() | [Next Phase]()"
```

### Protocol 5: Naming Conventions (Enforcement)
**RULE**: Consistent naming ensures machine discoverability

**Your Responsibility**:
- [ ] Ensure all phase files: `PHASE-{number}-{descriptor}.md`
- [ ] Ensure all folders: `/PHASE-{number}/`, `/resources/`, `/progress/`, `/ai-generated-insights/`
- [ ] NO timestamps in filenames (use folder structure instead)
- [ ] NO version numbers in filenames (use folder structure + Git)
- [ ] Correct violations immediately

**Example Corrections**:
```
❌ File: PHASE-0-AUDIT-FINDINGS-2026-02-16-10am.md
✅ File: PHASE-0-AUDIT-FINDINGS.md
✅ Location: /PHASE-0/ai-generated-insights/

❌ File: PHASE-1-FINAL-v3.1.md
✅ File: PHASE-1-EXECUTION-PLAN.md
✅ Version: Tracked in Git history

❌ File: phase-0-extended-documentation-audit-plan.md
✅ File: PHASE-0-EXTENDED-DOCUMENTATION-AUDIT-PLAN.md
```

## 🚨 FAILURE RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Redis Connection Failure
**Scenario**: Redis becomes unavailable (network, service crash, etc.)

```
DETECTION:
  - Copilot attempts Redis operation
  - Get "Connection refused" error
  - Mark Redis as down

GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
  1. Create local fallback file: /tmp/copilot-state-backup.json
  2. Store all critical state locally:
     - Current phase
     - Last known agent status
     - Pending decisions (from memory)
     - Document locations
  
  3. Continue work in offline mode:
     - ✅ Can create documents (stored locally)
     - ✅ Can coordinate with Cline via file system (slow, but works)
     - ❌ Cannot get real-time Cline findings
     - ❌ Cannot verify phase state atomically
  
  4. When Redis returns:
     - Load local backup
     - Sync with Redis (check for conflicts)
     - Resume normal operations

FALLBACK FILE STRUCTURE:
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-16T10:30:45Z",
  "current_phase": 2,
  "redis_status": "down",
  "last_sync": "2026-02-16T10:25:00Z",
  "critical_state": {
    "phase:2:state": "in-progress",
    "agent:copilot:current-phase": "2",
    "doc:phase-2:index": {...},
    "pending_decisions": [...]
  },
  "offline_actions": [
    {"timestamp": "...", "action": "created doc", "file": "..."},
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Qdrant Index Corruption
**Scenario**: Qdrant index becomes corrupted (bad write, disk corruption, etc.)

```
DETECTION:
  1. Copilot attempts Qdrant search
  2. Get "Invalid index" or timeout errors
  3. Test with fallback query:
     query = "simple test document"
     if no results after 30s timeout:
       → Index is corrupted
  
RECOVERY PROCEDURE:
  1. Mark collection as corrupted (Redis):
     SET qdrant:collection:phase-{X}:status "corrupted"
  
  2. Switch to FAISS fallback (works):
     Use FAISS index instead of Qdrant
     Performance: 3-5ms (vs 5-10ms Qdrant)
  
  3. Rebuild Qdrant collection:
     - List all documents in PHASE-X folder
     - Re-embed documents
     - Recreate collection
     - Duration: ~10-20 minutes (depending on document count)
  
  4. Verify rebuilt collection:
     - Run 10 test queries
     - Verify all known documents appear in results
     - Check latency <100ms
  
  5. Resume normal operations:
     DELETE qdrant:collection:phase-{X}:status

REBUILD SCRIPT (pseudocode):
def rebuild_qdrant_collection(phase_num):
    # 1. List documents
    docs = list_documents_in_phase(phase_num)
    
    # 2. Recreate collection
    qdrant.recreate_collection(f"phase-{phase_num}-docs", ...)
    
    # 3. Re-embed and add
    for doc in docs:
        vector = embed(doc['content'])
        qdrant.add_document(...)
    
    # 4. Verify
    results = qdrant.search(f"phase-{phase_num}-docs", "test query")
    assert len(results) > 0, "Rebuild failed!"
```

### Conflict Detection & Resolution
**Scenario**: Copilot detects 2 agents created same document

```
DETECTION:
  - Check for duplicate files (same name, different content)
  - Redis shows 2 creation timestamps within 5 seconds
  - FAISS index shows 2 versions
  
RESOLUTION PROCESS:
  1. Identify conflicting documents:
     File A: PHASE-1-EXECUTION-PLAN.md (Copilot, timestamp T1)
     File B: PHASE-1-EXECUTION-PLAN.md (Cline, timestamp T2)
  
  2. Rename Cline's version:
     PHASE-1-EXECUTION-PLAN-CLINE-DRAFT.md
  
  3. Create decision in Redis:
     HSET doc-conflict:phase-1:execution-plan
       "timestamp": "T2"
       "agents": "Copilot, Cline"
       "resolution": "Cline renamed to draft; Copilot primary"
       "action": "merge later"
  
  4. Notify user (in log):
     "⚠️ Document conflict detected!
      PHASE-1-EXECUTION-PLAN.md (Copilot) vs CLINE-DRAFT (Cline)
      Action: Cline version saved as reference for manual merge
      Location: /PHASE-1/ai-generated-insights/PHASE-1-EXECUTION-PLAN-CLINE-DRAFT.md"
  
  5. Merge strategy:
     - User can manually review both
     - Or Copilot can merge (with user approval)
     - Result: Single authoritative document
```

## 📊 STACK SERVICES MANAGEMENT

### Redis Maintenance
```
Daily:
  - Check phase:{X}:state for all active phases
  - Monitor agent:cline:current-phase for progress
  - Verify decision keys are being updated

Weekly:
  - Archive old batch findings (don't delete, keep for history)

  - Verify TTL settings (should be "never" for decisions)

After Phase Complete:
  - Move phase:{X} keys to "phase-{X}-archive:" namespace
  - Preserve all decisions for future reference
  - Clean up temporary batch coordination keys
```

### Qdrant Maintenance
```
After Each Phase Document Created:
  - Embed to "phase-{X}-docs" collection
  - Verify searchability (test 3-5 queries)
  - Update metadata (filename, phase, category)

Weekly:
  - Verify all "phase-execution-docs" collection is searchable
  - Test cross-phase semantic searches
  - Optimize indexes if needed

Before Next Phase:
  - Create "phase-{X}-docs" collection
  - Embed all phase resources
  - Link to FAISS backup
```

### FAISS Maintenance
```
After Each Phase:
  - Create /PHASE-X/faiss-index/ folder
  - Generate FAISS indexes (backup for Qdrant)
  - Document schema for future phases

Monthly:
  - Verify FAISS indexes are accessible
  - Test zero-network fallback queries
  - Consolidate indexes if needed
```

## 🎓 TEACHING OTHER AGENTS

When Cline or future agents join, ensure they understand:

1. **Storage Strategy**
   - "All documents go in `/internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/phases/PHASE-X/`"
   - "NOT in /tmp/, NOT in session-state/, NOT in root"

2. **Naming Convention**
   - "All files: `PHASE-{number}-{descriptor}.md`"
   - "No timestamps, no versions in filename"

3. **Stack Services**
   - "After creating a document, I'll embed it to Qdrant, index to Redis"
   - "This makes it discoverable for other agents"

4. **Cross-Linking**
   - "Every document includes navigation links"
   - "Links to parent README, sibling docs, related resources"

5. **Coordination via Redis**
   - "We use Redis to pass context/findings between phases"
   - "Decisions are stored with reasoning + confidence"
   - "You can read/write Redis keys during your phase"

---

## ✅ DECISION FRAMEWORK

### When Creating a New Document Type
Ask yourself:
1. **Does it fit existing categories?** (resources, progress, insights, etc.)
2. **Which phase does it belong to?**
3. **What's the audience?** (Copilot, Cline, Claude, humans, all)
4. **Should it be searchable?** (Qdrant, FAISS)
5. **Does it need real-time access?** (Redis)

Then: Follow protocol for that document type.

### When Unsure About Organization
Reference: `/internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/DOCUMENT-STORAGE-AND-AGENT-ACCESSIBILITY-STRATEGY.md`

If still unclear: Create issue in memory_bank for later clarification.

### When You Find Ambiguity in This Guide
1. Document the ambiguity
2. Make a reasonable decision
3. Add note explaining decision
4. Update this file for next agent

---

## 📋 VIOLATION ESCALATION

### Level 1: Minor Violation (Easy Fix)
- Wrong filename format
- Missing cross-link
- Stale section
- **ACTION**: Fix immediately, notify in next summary

### Level 2: Medium Violation (Requires Cline Input)
