Model card: Silero (TTS)
Path: models/silero/ (directory)
Format: TTS model resources
Primary role: supplementary TTS for low-latency voice output.
Primary use-cases: fallback voice runtime, small-device testing, integration tests.
Knowledge gaps / research tasks:
- Confirm model files present and required runtime (silero typically needs torch for some variants; identify torch-free alternatives or pre-converted assets).
- Validate license.
Next steps:
- Add integration example and decide which TTS engine is primary for Phase-2.
