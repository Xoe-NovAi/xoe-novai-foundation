```

---

## ⏱️ Timeline Overview

```
Week 1:
├─ Day 1: Phase 1 (diagnostics) + Phases 6-start (docs)
├─ Day 2: Phases 2-5 (operations) + Phases 6-8 (docs)
└─ Result: ✅ Fully operational stack + complete documentation

Week 2:

## 🚀 Phase Structure

Each phase in EXPANDED-PLAN.md includes:

1. **Phase Goal** - What we're trying to achieve
2. **Tasks** - 5-20 specific checklist items
3. **Technical Commands** - Copy-paste ready commands
4. **Success Criteria** - How we know it's done
5. **Risk Mitigation** - What could go wrong + fixes

---

## 🤖 Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Responsibility | Phases |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Copilot CLI** | Coordination, execution, verification | All (lead) |
| **Cline CLI** (Kimi K2.5) | Heavy lifting - code, docs, research | 2, 6-11 |
| **Grok MC** | Optional research synthesis | 10 |
| **Gemini CLI** | Command execution, filesystems | Support |

---

## 📂 Artifact Storage

All deliverables saved to **project folders** (NOT /tmp or /session-state):

```
/logs/                    ← Phase reports, test results
/docs/                    ← User documentation
  ├── architecture/       ← System design with Mermaid
  ├── api/                ← API reference
  ├── design-patterns/    ← Core patterns
  └── models/             ← Model research
/internal_docs/           ← Research findings
/memory_bank/             ← Progress & protocols
/scripts/                 ← Runbooks & automation
```

---

## ✅ Success Validation

**Track A**: 9/9 services operational, zero errors, memory < 4.5GB  
**Track B**: 15+ diagrams, 50+ APIs documented, all ADRs written  
**Track C**: Crawler understood, models researched, IAM validated  
**Track D**: Memory bank current, docs synchronized  

---

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

1. **Parallel Tracks**: A & B run simultaneously (Copilot + Cline)
2. **Agent Delegation**: Cline (262K context) for research & docs
3. **Critical Path**: Phases 1→2→3→4 sequential, rest parallel
4. **Vikunja Priority**: Phases 1-5 deliver PM-ready system
5. **Memory Budget**: Target < 4.5GB for Ryzen 5700U compatibility

---

## 📞 Questions?

Before execution, clarify:

- ✓ Vikunja PM feature scope (full or basic?)
- ✓ Documentation detail level (15+ Mermaid OK?)
- ✓ Ancient Greek model preferences (3-5 candidates?)
- ✓ Cline delegation approval (OK to use Kimi K2.5?)
- ✓ Timeline flexibility (16.25 hours OK?)

---

## 🚀 Ready to Execute?

**Step 1**: Choose your reading strategy (see above)  
**Step 2**: Review relevant plan file(s)  
**Step 3**: Ask any clarifying questions  
**Step 4**: Say "start execution" or "proceed with phase 1"
