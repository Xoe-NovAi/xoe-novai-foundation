## ❓ Part 3: Final Knowledge Gaps & Advanced Research Questions

### Knowledge Gap 1: T5-Ancient-Greek Model Feasibility

**Status**: Deferred to Phase 10 (pending Claude guidance)

**Research Questions**:
1. **Encoder-Decoder Compatibility**: Can T5-Ancient-Greek use mmap() like decoder-only Krikri?
   - Hypothesis: T5 is encoder-decoder, might require full model in memory
   - Impact: If YES → Alternative to BERT. If NO → Stick with BERT.

2. **Model Quality vs Memory Tradeoff**:
   - BERT: 91.2% accuracy, 110MB Q8_0, <100ms latency ✅
   - T5: 92% accuracy (claimed), ~880MB even quantized, latency unknown
   - Question: Is 0.8% accuracy improvement worth 8x memory cost?

3. **Distillation Feasibility**:
   - Could we distill BERT to ~50MB without accuracy loss?
   - Would DistilBERT-Ancient-Greek be possible to create?
   - Timeline: Is this feasible in Phase 10 (~2 hours)?

4. **Encoder Requirements for XNAi**:
   - Current stack expects encoder (embeddings for Qdrant)
   - T5 encoder output compatibility with existing pipeline?
   - Or would we need separate embedding model anyway?

5. **Licensing & Attribution**:
   - T5-Ancient-Greek creator attribution requirements?
   - Apache 2.0 compatible or require special handling?
   - Affects documentation and deployment decisions

**Recommendation Request**:
> Based on the above, should Copilot:
> - A) Proceed with pranaydeeps/Ancient-Greek-BERT (proven, safe choice)
> - B) Evaluate T5-Ancient-Greek as alternative in Phase 10
> - C) Attempt distillation to create smaller model
> - D) Use BERT + research T5 for Phase 16+ future work

---

### Knowledge Gap 2: Krikri-7B License & Model Pedigree

**Status**: Unverified

**Research Questions**:
1. **License Clarity**: 
   - Krikri-7B-Instruct Q5_K_M - license status unclear
   - Is it compatible with XNAi sovereignty requirements (open-source, no telemetry)?
   - Any attribution requirements?

2. **Model Provenance**:
   - Is Krikri-7B trained specifically for Ancient Greek or is it a fine-tune of another base model?
   - Training data sources (public or proprietary)?
   - Affects reproducibility and long-term maintenance

3. **Performance Validation**:
   - Krikri-7B translation quality for Ancient Greek vs English?
   - Any published benchmarks for classical text handling?
   - Or will Phase 10 testing be our first validation?

**Recommendation Request**:
> Before Phase 1 execution, could Claude verify:
> - Krikri license status (Apache? MIT? Unknown?)
> - Model training documentation (open-source pedigree?)
> - Any concerns for XNAi deployment?

---

### Knowledge Gap 3: Memory Optimization for Concurrent Models

**Status**: Documented for sequential access, untested for concurrent

**Research Questions**:
1. **Concurrent Model Loading**:
   - If user requests both BERT analysis + Krikri translation in same request
   - Will mmap() page cache share work across both models?
   - Or will we exceed 6GB budget with concurrent access?

2. **Page Cache Behavior**:
   - First call to BERT: loads ~110MB
   - First call to Krikri (after BERT): mmap page fault, loads 1-2GB working set
   - Question: Can we guarantee page-fair scheduling to avoid OOM killer?

3. **zRAM Integration Strategy**:
   - Recommended zRAM: 12GB (2x physical RAM)
   - Does zRAM compression work efficiently with mmap()'d pages?
   - Or should infrequently accessed Krikri pages NOT be swapped?

4. **Request Queueing Design**:
   - Should we limit Krikri concurrent requests to 1?
   - Or can we queue multiple requests with memory isolation?
   - What's safe concurrent model count?

**Recommendation Request**:
> For Phase 10 testing, should we:
> - A) Implement single-request-at-a-time Krikri (safest, simplest)
> - B) Implement request queue with memory monitoring (complex, more flexible)
> - C) Test both approaches, pick winner after profiling?

---

### Knowledge Gap 4: Security Policy Definition for Zero-Trust

**Status**: Documented architecture, untested enforcement

**Research Questions**:
1. **Ed25519 Handshake Validation**:
   - Current implementation in `/data/iam_agents.db` - is it cryptographically sound?
   - Replay attack protection: Are we checking timestamps properly?
   - Should we add key rotation procedures?

2. **Redis ACL Testing Strategy**:
   - REDIS-ACL-AGENT-BUS-CONFIG.md provides ACL syntax
   - Question: Should we pre-generate test suite for Phase 11 (3 tests documented)?
   - Should we add load testing (what happens under stress)?

3. **Policy Enforcement Points**:
   - ACLs at Redis layer ✓ (documented in Phase 11)
   - Ed25519 at agent layer ? (not fully documented)
   - TLS for inter-agent comms? (not mentioned)
   - Should Phase 11 add TLS encryption for streams?

4. **Audit & Compliance Logging**:
   - SECURITY-TRINITY-VALIDATION-PLAYBOOK.md covers Syft/Grype/Trivy
   - Question: Should we add Redis ACL audit logging?
   - (i.e., log all failed ACL attempts)

**Recommendation Request**:
> For Phase 11 & 13, should security implementation include:
> - A) Just ACL as documented (Phase 11 scope)
> - B) ACL + Ed25519 validation audit (Phase 11 enhancement)
> - C) ACL + Ed25519 + TLS + compliance logging (larger scope)

---

### Knowledge Gap 5: Model Memory Profiling Strategy

**Status**: Metrics defined, actual profiling plan TBD

**Research Questions**:
1. **Memory Profiling Tools**:
   - Recommended: `smem -t -k` for accurate RSS
   - Alternative: `psutil` Python library (in code)
   - Question: Should we wrap profiling in decorator for all model calls?

2. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Should Phase 12 add Prometheus exporter for model memory metrics?
   - Or is initial Phase 10 validation sufficient?
   - Question: Do we need real-time memory alerts?

3. **Load Testing Specifics**:
   - GGUF-MMAP-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md provides memory target: <5.5GB peak
   - Question: What load should we test?
   - - 100 sequential BERT requests?
   - - 10 concurrent Krikri requests?
   - - Mixed workload?

4. **Degradation Strategy**:
   - If we hit memory limits, what happens?
   - Kill Krikri? Queue requests? Fail gracefully?
   - Question: Should Phase 10 include fallback logic?

**Recommendation Request**:
> For Phase 10 memory validation:
> - What testing strategy do you recommend?
> - Should we include graceful degradation (fallback logic)?
> - Do we need Prometheus monitoring added in Phase 12?
