# Assistant Resources Catalog

Purpose: single index of resources an assistant (human or AI) can use to act autonomously in this repo.

Sections
- Onboarding: `internal_docs/assistant_onboarding/*`
- Runbooks: `internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/*` (Phase‑5A docs)
- Templates: `assistant_onboarding/TEMPLATES/*`
- Playbooks: `internal_docs/ansible/playbooks/*`
- Tests: `tests/*` (search `phase5a` prefix for relevant tests)
- Expert knowledge: `expert-knowledge/*` (research artifacts)

How assistants should use this catalog
- Start with `ASSISTANT-ONBOARDING.md` and `ONBOARDING-ROADMAP.md`.
- Consult `TOOLS_AND_AGENTS.md` to choose external tools (Claude, Grok, Gemini) for deep research or large-context synthesis.
- Use `TEMPLATES/PROVISION_RUNNER_TEMPLATE.sh` for provisioning guidance.
