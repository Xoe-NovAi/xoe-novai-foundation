# Documentation Standards

## Overview

Consistent, clear documentation is essential for project success and knowledge sharing across the AI development ecosystem.

## Required Sections

All projects must include these sections in their README.md:

### Project Header
```markdown
# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Created:** {{CREATED_DATE}}
**Type:** [Research|Development|Experimental] Project
**Status:** [Active|Completed|Archived]
```

### Core Sections
- **Overview**: Brief description and objectives
- **Requirements**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Implementation**: How it will be done
- **Status**: Current progress and blockers
- **Next Steps**: Immediate priorities

## Documentation Guidelines

### File Organization
- Keep documentation in the project root
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `api-design.md`, not `doc1.md`)
- Group related documents in subdirectories
