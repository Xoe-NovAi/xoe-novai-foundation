## Project Types & Variations

### Research Projects
- Extended ideation and exploration phases
- Flexible timelines and deliverables
- Emphasis on knowledge generation over product delivery
- May iterate between phases multiple times

### Development Projects
- Standard software development lifecycle
- Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Emphasis on quality and reliability
- Structured testing and validation phases

### Experimental Projects
- Flexible lifecycle with frequent iteration
- Emphasis on learning and discovery
- May pivot or change direction based on findings
- Less rigid success criteria and timelines

## Decision Gates

### Phase Transition Reviews
- **Planning → Design**: Requirements approved, resources committed
- **Design → Development**: Technical design approved, team ready
- **Development → Testing**: Core functionality complete, ready for validation
- **Testing → Deployment**: All tests pass, stakeholders approve
- **Deployment → Operations**: System stable, support processes ready

### Go/No-Go Decisions
Each gate includes evaluation of:
