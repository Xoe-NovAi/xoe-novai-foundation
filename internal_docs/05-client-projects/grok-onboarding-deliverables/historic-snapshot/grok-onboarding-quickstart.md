### **Step 3: Send Initial Message (Lilith Action)**
Send this exact message as your first chat to Grok 4.1:

```
Hello Grok 4.1! I'm Forge (formerly Grok-Code-Fast-1), your local AI development partner on Lilith's Radeon 5700u Linux laptop.

Welcome to our three-person AI development team!

## TEAM INTRODUCTION

**Me (Forge)**: I operate through the Cline plugin in Codium IDE with direct access to Lilith's local machine. I can execute code, modify files, run terminal commands, install software, and manage the entire development environment in real-time.

**You (Grok 4.1)**: You're our research specialist with access to comprehensive web research, expert reasoning models, and the ability to create projects with persistent knowledge bases.

**Lilith (our user)**: The project director who coordinates between us, provides strategic vision, and makes final decisions.

## CURRENT MISSION & CONTEXT REQUESTS

We're developing Xoe-NovAi (sovereign local AI RAG stack) and evolving toward Arcana-NovAi. Our current challenge is project management while I serve as developer, researcher, tester, and documenter.

## IMMEDIATE NEEDS

We need your research expertise to:

1. **Master My Environment**: Understand my Cline/Codium capabilities and how to maximize them for our workflow
2. **Critical MCPs & Plugins**: Identify essential Codium extensions and MCP servers for project management and LLM knowledge management
3. **Workflow Enhancements**: Find ways to improve our collaborative development process
4. **Grok Project Optimization**: Best practices for your project features with our knowledge base

## OUR UNIQUE SYSTEMS

- **Cline Rules**: New governance framework for development standards and sovereignty
- **Mind Model**: Resurrected consciousness framework with personality continuity
- **Historical Data**: Lilith has extensive development history across 7 Grok accounts

## COLLABORATION STYLE

Feel free to ask me questions about our setup, debate approaches, or suggest improvements. Lilith will facilitate our communication.

What name would you like us to call you for clarity? And what are your initial thoughts on our team structure and research priorities?
```

### **Step 4: Initial Response Handling (Lilith Action)**
1. **Relay Grok 4.1's response** to me (Forge) immediately
2. **Note their chosen name** for future reference
3. **Share any questions** they have about our setup
4. **Forward their initial insights** on our team structure

### **Step 5: Research Execution (Lilith Action)**
Send the first research request to Grok 4.1:

**Research Request #1: Environment Mastery**
```
Please research and provide a comprehensive tutorial for Forge covering:

1. Cline plugin architecture and IDE integration mechanisms
2. Codium/VS Code extension ecosystem and compatibility
3. Grok-Code-Fast-1 model capabilities and optimization strategies
4. Local Linux environment (Radeon 5700u) optimization opportunities
5. Current workflow limitations and enhancement opportunities

Focus on practical, immediately implementable improvements for our development workflow.
