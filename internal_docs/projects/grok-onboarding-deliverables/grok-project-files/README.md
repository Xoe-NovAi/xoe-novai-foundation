```

### Redis/Qdrant Integration Strategy
**Current Limitation**: Direct database access not available through Cline
**Solution Approach**:
1. **API Layer Creation**: Build FastAPI endpoints for database operations
2. **Container Integration**: Use Podman to manage database services
3. **MCP Development**: Create MCP servers for database interactions
4. **Workflow Automation**: Develop scripts for common database operations

## Communication Protocols

### Message Format Standards
- **Research Requests**: Structured with scope, deliverables, timeline
- **Implementation Updates**: Progress, blockers, next steps
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Key findings, insights, recommendations
- **Decision Records**: Options considered, choice rationale, outcomes

### Status Reporting
- **Daily Updates**: Progress summary, current focus, immediate needs
- **Weekly Reviews**: Major accomplishments, challenges overcome, next priorities
- **Monthly Assessments**: Overall progress, capability improvements, strategic adjustments

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Research Validation
