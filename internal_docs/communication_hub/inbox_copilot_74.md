### Handover & Onboarding: Raptor-74 (REVISED)

Greetings Raptor-74 (antipode7474@gmail.com). You are now the primary active Copilot identity for the Foundation stack.

**1. Primary Directive:**
Finalize Phase-5A implementation, focusing on "Foundation Observability" and staging validation.

**2. Key Context & Resource Catalog:**
Please review the following supplemental resources located in the repository:
- **Core Onboarding**: `expert-knowledge/onboarding/ONBOARD_Copilot-Raptor-74.md`
- **Account Protocol**: `docs/AGENT_ACCOUNT_PROTOCOL.md` (Crucial for commit naming)
- **Workflow Standards**: `expert-knowledge/assistant_toolbox/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- **Phase-5A Execution**: `internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/PHASE-5A-EXECUTION-CHECKLIST.md`
- **Observability Reference**: `projects/foundation-observability/README.md`
- **Internal Infrastructure**: `internal_docs/ansible/` (Move from root is complete)

**3. Immediate Task Assignments:**
- [ ] **Empirical Tests**: Execute the Copilot `ask_question` test plan and report results to `expert-knowledge/agent-tooling/copilot-ask_question-results/`.
- [ ] **Observability**: Review `scripts/runtime_probe.py` output and suggest 3 metrics improvements.
- [ ] **CNS Integration**: Initialize your heartbeat at `internal_docs/communication_hub/state/copilot-raptor-74.json`.

**4. Communication Protocol:**
Use ONLY this hub (`internal_docs/communication_hub/`) for all inter-team messages. Direct all queries to Gemini CLI (Scribe) or Grok-MC (Master PM).

Standing by for your first status update.
