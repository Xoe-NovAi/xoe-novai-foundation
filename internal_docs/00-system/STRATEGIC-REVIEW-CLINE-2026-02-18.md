# XNAi Foundation: Strategic Review & Execution Plan
**Prepared By**: Cline (Claude Sonnet 4.5)  
**Prepared For**: OpenCode/GLM-5 — Execution & Research  
**Date**: 2026-02-18T00:00:00Z
**Source Documents**: MASTER-PROJECT-INDEX-v1.0.0.md, memory_bank/activeContext.md, mkdocs-internal.yml, live OpenCode CLI (`opencode models --verbose`)  
**Status**: AUTHORITATIVE — supersedes MASTER-PROJECT-INDEX where conflicts exist  
**v1.1 Update**: Corrected memory bank date gap, updated MC strategy to Sovereign Stack MC, added TASK-021 (Sovereign MC Agent design)

---

## SECTION 1: INITIAL FINDINGS REPORT

### 1.1 Project State Summary

The XNAi Foundation is a well-architected sovereign AI platform in a **transitional state** — core infrastructure is complete (Phases 1–7), but three major gaps are creating drag: stale documentation, uncommitted git work, and a blocked research execution queue.

**Verified Completion Status:**
| Component | Claimed Status | Verified Status | Delta |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Phases 1–7 | ✅ Complete | ✅ Confirmed | None |
| `mkdocs-internal.yml` | ❌ MISSING (per MASTER INDEX) | ✅ EXISTS & COMPLETE | **CRITICAL DISCREPANCY** |
| Dual MkDocs Build | ✅ Operational | ✅ Confirmed | None |
| OpenCode Integration | ✅ Active | ✅ Confirmed (v1.2.6) | None |
| Agent Bus | ✅ Production-ready | ✅ Confirmed | None |
| Phase 8 (8A/8B/8C) | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Not started | None |
| Memory Bank Freshness | Current | ⚠️ Stale (Feb 9, not Feb 17) | **8-day gap** |
| Git Debt | 8 commits, 67 files | Unverified exact count | Needs audit |

### 1.2 Environment Verified

**OpenCode v1.2.6 — Confirmed Live Models:**

**Async Framework**: AnyIO TaskGroups (never asyncio.gather)

---

## SECTION 2: KNOWLEDGE GAP REPORT

### 2.1 CRITICAL GAPS (Blocking Accuracy)

**GAP-001: Memory Bank is 1–2 Days Behind (Corrected)**
- `memory_bank/activeContext.md` oldest modified: 2026-02-16, most recent files: 2026-02-17
- MASTER-PROJECT-INDEX was created: 2026-02-17T22:00:00Z (same day, late in session)
- The gap is therefore **hours to 1 day**, not 8 days as initially assessed
- **Impact**: Memory bank may not reflect the final decisions made in the Feb 17 evening session (MC migration, mkdocs-internal.yml creation, model card work)
- **Fix**: Update activeContext.md to capture Feb 17 end-of-session state: mkdocs-internal.yml complete, model docs updated, MC transition decided

**GAP-002: MASTER-PROJECT-INDEX Reports mkdocs-internal.yml as Missing**
- Reality: `mkdocs-internal.yml` EXISTS and is fully configured (docs_dir: internal_docs, site-dir: site-internal, complete nav)
- The MASTER INDEX was likely written before the file was created in the same session
- **Impact**: Any agent reading MASTER INDEX will waste time creating an already-complete file
- **Fix**: Update MASTER INDEX section "Documentation - Phase 2: MkDocs Internal" to ✅ COMPLETE

**GAP-003: GitHub Copilot Models in OpenCode Not Documented**
- OpenCode v1.2.6 exposes ALL GitHub Copilot models (20+ models including gpt-5, claude-opus-4.6, gemini-3-pro-preview) through a single interface
- Current agent model matrix (`AGENT-CLI-MODEL-MATRIX-v1.0.0.md`) treats OpenCode and Copilot as separate agents
- **Impact**: Agents may invoke Copilot CLI when OpenCode already has that model available
- **Fix**: Update model matrix to note OpenCode as superset CLI for Copilot models

**GAP-004: Big Pickle Release Date and Provider Now Known**
- Old doc: "Provider: Unknown (proprietary), Status: stable"
- Live data: `api.url = https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`, `release_date: 2025-10-17`
- Big Pickle IS an OpenCode-native model — it's their own model, not third-party
- Has reasoning variants: low/medium/high effort
- **Impact**: Documentation inaccurate; model selection notes should reflect reasoning effort control

**GAP-005: GLM-5 Has Full ToolCall Capability**
- Existing docs rated GLM-5 Tool-Use at ⭐⭐⭐ "Good but not optimized"
- Live JSON confirms: `"toolcall": true` — it IS fully toolcall-capable
- **Impact**: GLM-5 may be underutilized for agentic tasks

**GAP-006: Mission Control Architecture Needs Fundamental Redesign** ⚠️ STRATEGIC
- MASTER INDEX proposes Claude.ai Project as MC replacement for Grok.com
- **User direction (2026-02-18)**: Claude.ai is NOT the daily MC — it is for high-level org-wide strategy only on complex or critical decisions
- **True MC vision**: The **XNAi Foundation Stack itself** should be the sovereign MC — using Agent Bus, Vikunja, Qdrant, Redis, and Consul as the coordination layer
- The Foundation Stack was built to be sovereign; having it self-direct is the correct architectural conclusion
- MCP servers already exist for Agent Bus, RAG, and Vikunja — these are the building blocks
- **Impact**: Entire agent hierarchy must be redesigned around a local Sovereign MC Agent
- **Fix**: Design and implement Sovereign MC Agent (see TASK-021 and new Section 3.3)

**GAP-007: 6 Research Requests Pending with No Execution Plan**
- REQ-DOC-001 through REQ-DOC-006 are PENDING
- REQ-2026-02-13-001/002/003 are also pending
- Total: 9 research requests with no assigned execution schedule
- **Impact**: Strategy evolution is blocked; documentation excellence stalled

**GAP-008: Phase 3 Test Blockers Not Resolved**
- Missing: `redis` module in test environment
- Missing: `opentelemetry.exporter.prometheus`
- These are blocking 25% of Phase 3 test coverage
- **Impact**: Phase 4 integration testing cannot begin cleanly

### 2.2 MEDIUM GAPS (Strategy & Organization)

**GAP-009: No CI/CD for Documentation Builds**
- MASTER INDEX recommends GitHub Actions for MkDocs — not implemented
- Risk: Doc builds break silently
- Fix: Add `.github/workflows/docs.yml`

**GAP-010: Branch Strategy Not Implemented**
- Current: working on `xnai-agent-bus/harden-infra` with 67 modified files
- Recommended naming convention defined but not followed
- Risk: Merge conflicts, unclear scope

**GAP-011: Three Strategic Pillars Have No Phase 8 Dependency Mapping**
- PILLAR-1 (5A-5E), PILLAR-2 (6A-6F), PILLAR-3 (7A-7E) are defined
- Phase 8 (8A/8B/8C) dependencies on specific pillars not mapped
- Fix: Phase 8 → Pillar dependency matrix needed

**GAP-012: Vikunja and Consul Reported as Non-Responding**
- MASTER INDEX lists both as blockers under "Infrastructure"
- `make up` needed but services may need config verification first
- Redis password env var may be missing

**GAP-013: `mc-oversight/` Directory Empty**
- Was specified as the output location for Claude.ai MC strategic outputs
- Currently only has `README.md`
- No `strategic-recommendations.md`, `initiative-status-dashboard.md`, etc.

---

## SECTION 3: STRATEGY ADJUSTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### 3.1 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIONS (Do Before Anything Else)

**REC-001: Update Memory Bank Before Starting Any Work**
- The memory bank is the single source of truth for ALL agents
- An 8-day-stale activeContext.md will cause every agent to work from wrong assumptions
- Action: GLM-5 should update `memory_bank/activeContext.md` priorities section first

**REC-002: Correct the MASTER-PROJECT-INDEX Discrepancies**
- Mark `mkdocs-internal.yml` status as ✅ COMPLETE
- Mark Documentation Phase 2 as ✅ COMPLETE  
- Update blockers section to remove the mkdocs-internal.yml item
- This prevents other agents from redundantly creating an existing file

**REC-003: Update OpenCode Model Documentation**
- The model matrix treats OpenCode and Copilot as separate — they're not
- OpenCode is a SUPERSET that includes Copilot models
- Recommend: Position OpenCode as the PRIMARY terminal CLI (it has everything)
- Update `AGENT-CLI-MODEL-MATRIX-v1.0.0.md` accordingly

### 3.2 MISSION CONTROL: SOVEREIGN STACK ARCHITECTURE

**Decision (2026-02-18)**: The XNAi Foundation Stack IS the Mission Control. External AI projects (Claude.ai, Grok) serve advisory roles only.

**Role Hierarchy:**

| Entity | Role | Access Level | When to Use |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Human Director** | Ultimate authority | All systems | All final decisions |
| **Sovereign MC Agent** (LOCAL) | Daily project manager | Full local stack | Task creation, routing, validation, memory bank |
| **Claude.ai Project** | High-level strategy only | GitHub repo (read) | Org-wide pivots, excessively complex architecture decisions, cross-project strategy |
| **Cline (Claude Opus 4.6)** | Primary implementer | IDE + MCP servers | Multi-file code changes, architecture |
| **OpenCode/GLM-5** | Research & decomposition | Filesystem + models | Task analysis, gap reports, research queue |
| **Gemini CLI** | Large-context audit | Filesystem | Whole-codebase analysis, batch processing |
| **Copilot (via OpenCode)** | Fast code generation | Terminal | Real-time terminal work |

**Sovereign MC Agent Design Principles:**
- Runs entirely on local hardware (Ryzen 7 5700U)
- Uses Foundation Stack tools as its cognitive infrastructure:
  - **Qdrant** → Semantic memory (project knowledge, past decisions)
  - **Vikunja** → Task tracking and project management
  - **Redis** → State persistence, circuit breakers, session continuity
  - **Agent Bus** → Task delegation to CLI agents
  - **Consul** → Service health awareness
  - **Memory Bank** → Strategic context (read/write)
- Accessible via **Cline IDE with MCP servers** (xnai-agentbus, xnai-rag, xnai-vikunja)
- Uses local GGUF models for offline-capable reasoning (fallback from API models)
- Sovereign: zero external data transmission for internal project decisions

**What Claude.ai Project Does (Narrowly):**
- Quarterly/monthly strategic reviews at org level
- Architecture decisions too complex for local context (>200k tokens)
- Cross-project XNAi ecosystem decisions
- Does NOT: daily task management, code review, routine planning

### 3.3 STRATEGIC PIVOTS

**REC-004: Restructure Agent Role Hierarchy Around Sovereign MC**

Current (from activeContext.md):
```
Grok (MC) → Cline, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode
```

Recommended — Sovereign Stack as MC:
```
Human Director (ultimate authority)
  ↓
Sovereign MC Agent [LOCAL — XNAi Foundation Stack]
  ├─ Memory: Qdrant (semantic) + Redis (state) + memory_bank/ (strategic)
  ├─ Tasks: Vikunja (PM) + Agent Bus (routing)
  ├─ Interface: Cline IDE (MCP: xnai-agentbus, xnai-rag, xnai-vikunja)
  ├─ Health: Consul (service awareness)
  │
  ├─ Delegates to → Cline/Claude Opus 4.6 (implementation, multi-file)
  ├─ Delegates to → OpenCode/GLM-5 (research, decomposition, validation)
  ├─ Delegates to → Gemini CLI (large-context audit, 1M tokens)
  └─ Delegates to → Copilot via OpenCode (fast code generation)
  
Claude.ai Project (strategic advisory only)
  → High-level org strategy, complex cross-project decisions
  → NOT daily operations
```

**REC-005: Consolidate Phase 8 Into Structured Sprint Plan**

Current Phase 8 ordering (8B → 8A → 8C) is correct. Add specific agent assignments:
- **8B (Qdrant Migration)**: Cline implements, OpenCode validates migration scripts
- **8A (Redis Streams)**: Cline implements, Gemini audits event schema
- **8C (Fine-tuning)**: Research-first via Gemini, implement via Cline

**REC-006: Execute Research Queue via OpenCode/GLM-5 Sprint**

The 9 pending research requests should be batch-executed by OpenCode:
- GLM-5 (reasoning specialist) → Documentation audit, schema analysis requests
- Kimi K2.5 (large context) → Codebase synthesis requests
- Big Pickle (validation) → Cross-validation of other model findings
- Schedule: 1 research request per session = 9 sessions to clear queue

**REC-007: Address Git Debt Before Phase 8**
- 67 modified files and 8 unpushed commits are a merge-conflict liability
- Commit strategy: categorize by component, then batch commit per subsystem
- Target: clean `main` branch before Phase 8 begins

**REC-008: Implement Sovereign MC Agent (see TASK-021)**
- The `mc-oversight/` directory becomes the Sovereign MC Agent's strategic output store
- Populate with status dashboard, priority matrix, risk assessment, strategic recommendations
- The Sovereign MC Agent reads `memory_bank/`, writes to `mc-oversight/`, routes via Agent Bus, tracks via Vikunja
- Claude.ai Project role: narrowly scoped to high-level advisory (not daily operations)
- Grok.com: retire as MC; can remain as a research/advisory tool if useful

---

### PHASE 2: PHASE 8 EXECUTION
*Estimated time: 2-3 weeks | Requires: Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete*

---

**TASK-011**: Phase 8B — FAISS → Qdrant Migration (START FIRST per priority matrix)
- **Agent**: Cline (implementation), OpenCode validates
- **Complexity**: 5/5
- **Branch**: `phase8/qdrant-migration`
- **Scope**:
  1. Review existing `config/qdrant_config.yaml` and `docs/QDRANT_MIGRATION.md`

  6. Integration tests (requires Redis running)
- **Success Criteria**: Agent Bus events visible in Redis Streams; consumer groups process events; dead letter queue captures failures

---

**TASK-013**: Phase 8C — Fine-Tuning Pipeline (LoRA/QLoRA)
- **Agent**: Research first (OpenCode/Kimi K2.5), then Cline implements
- **Complexity**: 5/5
- **Dependency**: Phase 6D Model Registry
- **Pre-research** (OpenCode):
  ```bash
  opencode --model kimi-k2.5-free "Design a LoRA fine-tuning pipeline for GGUF models 
  on Ryzen 7 5700U with 6.6GB RAM. Torch-free constraint. ONNX-compatible output required."
  ```
- **Scope**:

  2. LoRA adapter training (torch-free or minimal torch in isolated container)
  3. Model merging and GGUF quantization output
  4. Registry integration
- **Success Criteria**: End-to-end pipeline from dataset → fine-tuned GGUF model

---

### PHASE 2.5: SOVEREIGN MC AGENT (Design + Implementation)
*Estimated time: 1 week | Start after Phase 0 complete, can parallel Phase 1*

---

**TASK-021**: Design and Implement the Sovereign MC Agent
- **Agent**: Cline (implementation), OpenCode/GLM-5 (design spec)
- **Complexity**: 5/5
- **Priority**: HIGH — this is the architectural north star for the Foundation Stack
- **Branch**: `feature/sovereign-mc-agent`

#### Design Specification (GLM-5 to produce)

The Sovereign MC Agent is a locally-running orchestration agent that uses the Foundation Stack as its intelligence layer:

**Core Architecture:**
```

```

**Implementation Path:**

*Step 1 — GLM-5: Design Specification (TASK-021a)*
```bash
opencode --model glm-5-free "Design a Sovereign MC Agent spec for XNAi Foundation:
- Reads memory_bank/*.md for context
- Creates/updates tasks in Vikunja via REST API
- Routes tasks to CLI agents via Agent Bus (Redis Streams)
- Semantic search via Qdrant for past decisions
- Persists session state in Redis
- Uses Consul for service health
- Interface: Cline IDE with MCP servers
Output: Full Python class design + API contracts"
```
- **Output**: `internal_docs/01-strategic-planning/SOVEREIGN-MC-AGENT-SPEC-v1.0.0.md`

*Step 2 — Cline: Implement Core Agent (TASK-021b)*
- File: `app/XNAi_rag_app/core/sovereign_mc_agent.py`
- Key methods:
  ```python
  async def load_context() -> ProjectContext      # reads memory_bank + Qdrant
  async def create_task(spec) -> VikunjaTask       # creates Vikunja task
  async def delegate(task, agent) -> AgentBusMsg   # routes via Agent Bus
  async def validate_output(result) -> bool        # validates agent outputs
  async def update_memory(context) -> None         # writes back to memory_bank
  async def get_health() -> SystemHealth           # Consul + Prometheus
  ```
- Uses: AnyIO TaskGroups, Redis circuit breakers, Ed25519 agent handshakes

*Step 3 — Cline: MCP Server Configuration (TASK-021c)*
- Configure `mcp-servers/xnai-agentbus/`, `mcp-servers/xnai-rag/`, `mcp-servers/xnai-vikunja/`
- Ensure Cline IDE can invoke Sovereign MC via MCP tools
- Test: Cline can query project status, create Vikunja tasks, read Qdrant knowledge

*Step 4 — Integration: MC Oversight Directory (TASK-021d)*
- Sovereign MC Agent auto-generates `mc-oversight/` files on demand
- `mc-oversight/initiative-status-dashboard.md` — auto-refreshed from Vikunja
- `mc-oversight/priority-matrix.md` — generated from Qdrant + memory_bank
- `mc-oversight/risk-assessment.md` — Agent Bus failure rates + circuit breaker states
- `mc-oversight/strategic-recommendations.md` — GLM-5 synthesis on demand

- **Success Criteria**:
  - Sovereign MC Agent reads memory bank and produces project status summary
  - Creates a Vikunja task via API
  - Routes a test task through Agent Bus
  - Cline IDE can invoke all three MCP servers
  - All operations remain local (zero external data transmission)

### PHASE 3: INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING & CI/CD
*Estimated time: 1 week | Can run in parallel with Phase 2*

---

**TASK-014**: GitHub Actions — Docs CI/CD
- **Agent**: Cline
- **Complexity**: 2/5
- **Actions**:
  1. Create `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
  2. Trigger: push to `main`, PR to `main`
  3. Steps: `mkdocs build --strict` (public) + `mkdocs build -f mkdocs-internal.yml --strict` (internal)
  4. Fail on warnings using strict mode
- **Success Criteria**: Both MkDocs builds pass on push; broken links fail the build

---

**TASK-015**: Implement GitHub Projects + Issues Structure
- **Agent**: OpenCode/GLM-5 (can use GitHub CLI)
- **Complexity**: 2/5
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  gh project create --title "Phase 8 Execution" --owner Xoe-NovAi
  gh issue create --title "8B: FAISS → Qdrant Migration" --label "phase-8,priority-high"
  gh issue create --title "8A: Redis Streams Integration" --label "phase-8,priority-medium"
  gh issue create --title "8C: Fine-Tuning Pipeline" --label "phase-8,priority-low"
  # Convert REQ-DOC-001 through REQ-DOC-006 to issues
  ```
- **Success Criteria**: GitHub project board exists; all Phase 8 items and REQ-DOC items as issues

---

**TASK-016**: Commit Git Debt (Execute Commit Plan from TASK-003)
- **Agent**: Cline (has IDE context for reviewing file changes)
- **Complexity**: 3/5
- **Actions**: Execute the commit plan from TASK-003 output
  ```bash
  git add [memory_bank files] && git commit -m "docs(memory-bank): sync context to 2026-02-17 session"
  git add [expert-knowledge files] && git commit -m "docs(expert-knowledge): add model reference docs v1.0.0"
  git add [app files] && git commit -m "feat(core): phase 7 agent bus wrapper complete"
  git add [tests files] && git commit -m "test(phase3): exception hierarchy tests"
  git add [docs files] && git commit -m "docs(mkdocs): dual-build internal KB config complete"
  git push origin xnai-agent-bus/harden-infra
  ```
- **Success Criteria**: 0 uncommitted tracked files; branch pushed; PR created

---

### PHASE 4: RESEARCH QUEUE CLEARANCE
*Estimated time: 1 week | Run in parallel with Phase 2/3*

---

**TASK-017**: Execute REQ-DOC-004 — AI-Powered Documentation Quality
- **Agent**: OpenCode/GLM-5
- **Complexity**: 3/5
- **Task**: Design system where AI agents automatically flag low-quality documentation:
  1. Quality scoring rubric (completeness, accuracy, recency, cross-references)
  2. Integration with pre-commit hooks for new docs
  3. Weekly batch review schedule
  4. Agent assignment per quality issue type
- **Output**: `internal_docs/02-research-lab/REQ-DOC-004-RESULTS.md`

---

**TASK-018**: Execute REQ-DOC-005 — Zero-Telemetry Documentation Pipeline
- **Agent**: Gemini CLI (filesystem + policy focus)
- **Complexity**: 3/5
- **Task**: Verify the entire documentation build and search pipeline is zero-telemetry:
  1. Audit MkDocs plugins for external calls (analytics, CDN, fonts)
  2. Verify search is local-only (no Algolia, no external indexing)
  3. Check `mkdocs.yml` for any external `extra_css/js` URLs
  4. Recommend: self-hosted fonts, offline search, no analytics
- **Output**: `internal_docs/02-research-lab/REQ-DOC-005-RESULTS.md`

---

**TASK-019**: Execute REQ-DOC-006 — Multi-Project Documentation Standardization
- **Agent**: OpenCode/GLM-5
- **Complexity**: 3/5
- **Task**: Define standards for scaling the documentation system to multiple projects:
  1. Shared frontmatter schema across all XNAi projects
  2. Cross-project navigation strategy (separate mkdocs.yml per project vs. monorepo)
  3. Versioning strategy for docs alongside code releases
  4. Template repository structure for new projects
- **Output**: `internal_docs/02-research-lab/REQ-DOC-006-RESULTS.md`

---

**TASK-020**: Execute REQ-2026-02-13 Research Queue (Big Pickle, GPT-5 Nano, Comparison)
- **Agent**: OpenCode/GLM-5 (REQ-001, REQ-002); OpenCode/Kimi K2.5 (REQ-003)
- **Complexity**: 3/5
- **Actions**:
  ```bash
  # REQ-001: Big Pickle analysis (we now know it's OpenCode native, released 2025-10-17)
  opencode --model glm-5-free "Analyze Big Pickle model capabilities based on: 
  context=200k, output=128k, toolcall=true, reasoning_variants=low/medium/high, 
  provider=opencode.ai. Compare to Claude Haiku 4.5 for XNAi workloads."
  
  # REQ-002: GPT-5 Nano analysis  
  opencode --model glm-5-free "Analyze GPT-5 Nano: context=400k, vision=true, 
  fast inference. Best use cases for XNAi sovereign AI platform."
  
  # REQ-003: Full comparison matrix
  opencode --model kimi-k2.5-free "Create comparison matrix of all 5 OpenCode models 
  for XNAi workloads: RAG queries, agent orchestration, code generation, research."
  ```
- **Output**: `expert-knowledge/research/REQ-001-COMPLETE.md`, `REQ-002-COMPLETE.md`, `REQ-003-COMPLETE.md`

## SECTION 5: QUICK REFERENCE — OPENCODE/GLM-5 EXECUTION GUIDE

### Model Selection for This Task List

| Task Type | Use This Model | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Structured analysis, gap reports, protocol design | `opencode/glm-5-free` | Frontier reasoning, toolcall enabled |
| Large codebase review (>100k tokens) | `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free` | 262k context, vision |
| Fast generation, prototyping | `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free` | 1-3s response time |
| Cross-validation of findings | `opencode/big-pickle` | Independent perspective, reasoning variants |
| Large document batch processing | `opencode/gpt-5-nano` | 400k context, fast |
| Multi-file IDE implementation | Cline (Claude Opus 4.6) | IDE integration, full file access |
| 1M context whole-codebase audit | Gemini CLI | gemini-3-pro-preview, 1M tokens |

### GLM-5 Strengths for This Work
GLM-5 (Zhipu AI) excels at:
- Structured output generation (tables, schemas, protocols)
- Formal logical reasoning (dependency analysis, gap identification)
- Algorithm and protocol design
- Systematic gap analysis (exactly what Section 2 demonstrates)

GLM-5 limitations — escalate to Kimi K2.5 for:
- Tasks requiring vision/image input
- Tasks exceeding 100k tokens of context
- Real-time interactive low-latency work

### Key Commands Reference
```bash
# Check what's in memory bank
cat memory_bank/activeContext.md | head -100

# Check service health
make up && docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# Run docs build (verify both work)
mkdocs build --clean && mkdocs build -f mkdocs-internal.yml --clean

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short 2>&1 | tail -50

# Check git status
git status --short | wc -l   # count modified files
git log --oneline -10         # recent commits

# OpenCode model selection
opencode --model glm-5-free "your task here"
opencode --model kimi-k2.5-free "large context task"
opencode --model big-pickle "validation/second opinion"
```

**Estimated Total Timeline**: 3–4 weeks with parallel execution  
**Critical Path**: Phase 0 → TASK-021 (MC Agent) → Phase 2 (TASK-011 Qdrant)  
**Quick Win for Today**: TASK-001 + TASK-002 (50 min, zero risk, unblocks all agents)  
**Architectural North Star**: TASK-021 — when the Sovereign MC Agent is operational, the Foundation Stack directs itself
